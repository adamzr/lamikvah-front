            <h2>Welcome to The Mikvah Society of Los Angeles</h2>

            <p>
            The <em>mitzvah</em> of <em>Taharat Hamishpacha</em> is central to the Jewish people
            and its observance brings holiness and purity into our family lives.
            </p>
            <p>
            With the aim of building a community Mikvah, The Mikvah Society of Los Angeles was
            founded in January 1974. It is a non-profit organization and relies on
            community support for its operation and maintenance.
            </p>
            <p>
            Since it opened its doors in October 1976, <em>Mikvat Esther</em>, The Mikvah
            Society of Los Angeles, has grown along	with the greater LA community.
            </p>
            <p>
            The Mikvah is open every night during the year, except on <em>Yom Kippur</em>
            and <em>Tisha B&rsquo;av</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
            All Halachic issues and policies are determined by the <em>Vaad Ha-Rabbanim</em>:
