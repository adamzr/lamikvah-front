<h1>Welcome to The Mikvah Society of Los Angeles</h1>

<p>
The <em>mitzvah</em> of <em>Taharat Hamishpacha</em> is central to the Jewish people
and its observance brings holiness and purity into our family lives.
</p>
<p>
With the aim of building a community Mikvah, The Mikvah Society of Los Angeles was
founded in January 1974. It is a non-profit organization and relies on
community support for its operation and maintenance.
</p>
<p>
Since it opened its doors in October 1976, <em>Mikvat Esther</em>, The Mikvah
Society of Los Angeles, has grown along	with the greater LA community.
</p>
<p>
The Mikvah is open every night during the year, except on <em>Yom Kippur</em>
and <em>Tisha B&rsquo;av</em>.
</p>
<p>
All Halachic issues and policies are determined by the <em>Vaad Ha-Rabbanim</em>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Rabbi Sholom Tendler
</li>
<li>
Rabbi Shimon Raichik
</li>
<li>
Rabbi Ezra Schochet
</li>
<li>
Rabbi Yosef Shusterman
