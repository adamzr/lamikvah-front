        <h5 class="card-title">COVID-19 Update</h5>
        <h6 class="card-text">Updated as of September 13, 2020</h6>

        <p class="card-text"><strong>Please read this carefully, as there may be additional policies since the last time you have used the mikvah.</strong></p>

        <p class="card-text" style="color: red;">Please note: It is your responsibility to inform us if you have had any exposure to Covid 19 in
            the past 14 days. Be assured that we will try to accommodate your situation by taking the
            appropriate precautions for your tevillah, while making sure that everyone remains safe.</p>

        <p class="card-text">If you have traveled <strong style="text-decoration: underline">or</strong> have been in close contact with anyone who has traveled <strong style="text-decoration: underline">or</strong> have been
            in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19, please understand, for
            the safety of <strong style="text-decoration: underline">ALL</strong> our users, we ask you to please be in touch with us directly (<a href="tel:+13109484432">310-948-4432</a>, for Vivian) <strong style="text-decoration: underline">before</strong> coming to use our Mikvah or making an appointment.
            It is essential that you do so, so we can guide you accordingly on an individual basis and so
            our community can feel comfortable continuing to use our Mikvah.</p>

        <p class="card-text"><strong>Face masks / coverings are required.</strong></p>

        <p class="card-text"><strong>Appointments are now required.</strong> We no longer allow walk-ins, except on Friday nights and
            Yom Tov evenings.</p>

        <p class="card-text"><strong>All preparations must be completed at home. No preparations will be allowed at the
            Mikvah. When booking your appointment select from either bath or shower options to
            view all available time slots.</strong> Once you have prepared at home, please do not shower
            before tevillah. An additional dip before your regular immersion count will suffice.</p>

        <p class="card-text">On Friday and Yom Tov evenings appointments are not required and users must come one
            hour after candle lighting time (for Yom Tov, based on candle lighting time of the first day).
            Please remain outside, maintaining social distancing until the Mikvah attendant escorts you
            to a room. Please be sure to come on time as we are only open for 30 minutes each Friday
            and Yom Tov night.</p>

        <p class="card-text">If you have been in contact with ANYONE that has tested positive for COVID-19, we cannot allow you to use the mikvah until you have waited 4 days from exposure, taken a nasal swab PCR test and received negative results. If during that period you are subsequently exposed to another individual who tests positive, the same process begins anew.</p>

        <p class="card-text">If you are exhibiting ANY COVID-type symptoms (dry cough, sore throat, fever, joint pain, loss of sense of smell or taste, etc.) even if you have not been in direct contact with someone who has yet been confirmed positive, please check with your doctor and your Rav, before using the Mikvah so that we do not risk spreading the virus to all the other users. Please remember each of us has an <em>achrayut</em> (responsibility) to everyone else in the community.</p>

        <p class="card-text">Each Mikvah user will have their temperature taken before entering the Mikvah. If there is any degree of fever whatsoever, the policy is that the user cannot be allowed in.
        </p>

        <p class="card-text">If you have contracted COVID-19, and have not yet tested negative after recuperation, we cannot allow you to use the mikvah.</p>

        <p class="card-text">When making your appointment, before confirming please double check that you have selected the correct date and time.</p>

        <p class="card-text">PLEASE NOTE AND PASS ALONG:  The Men’s Mikvah has not been open since the Coronavirus situation began and still remains closed. The Men’s Mikvah WILL NOT be open pre-Rosh haShana or pre-Yom Kippur</p>

        <p class="card-text">Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions (<a href="mailto:info@lamikvah.org">info@lamikvah.org</a> or my cell (text is preferable) <a href="tel:+13109484432">310-948-4432</a>, Vivian Lurie).</p>

        <p class="card-text">Please share these changes with friends and contacts who may not be aware of them.</p>

        <p class="card-text">With Hashem’s help and a communal effort, we will hopefully control the situation.</p>

        <p class="card-text">Thank you,</p>

  <h1>Appointments</h1>

  <p>Appointments can be made online for any night with the exception of Fridays and Yom Tov.</p>
  <p>
    Making an appointment online costs $36, which consists of the $30 mikvah visit fee, plus a $6 convenience fee.
    These fees are waived entirely for mikvah members. To learn more about membership, please see the <a
      routerLink="/fees-and-membership">membership page</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Appointments can be made up to one hour before the mikvah opens that day.
  </p>
  <p>
    Appointments can be cancelled anytime before the mikvah opens for a refund. After the mikvah opens, your appointment
    cannot be cancelled.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please show up on time. If you are not at the mikvah at the time of the appointment, you will lose your appointment,
    and any fees charged will not be refunded.
  </p>
  <p>
    All appointments are for 30 minutes. Please be sure to leave on time.
